                    <p>My name is Gavin Asay. I'm a new full-stack web developer currently attending the full-stack Coding Boot Camp with the University of Utah. Currently located in Orem, UT.</p>
                    <p>My prior work experience has made me an innovator in creating and managing online content, particularly for education applications, as a writer and editor. As my knowledge and skills grow, I will be seeking my first professional opportunities in development, incorporating my experience in scrum and kanban methodologies.</p>
